# Contributing to theo

Thank you for your interest in contributing to theo! We appreciate your support in making this project better.

## Code Contributions

**At this time, we are not accepting code contributions.** The project is currently in active development with a focused roadmap, and needs to maintain tight control over the codebase architecture and implementation decisions.

## How You Can Help

While we're not accepting code contributions, there are several valuable ways you can contribute to the project:

### 1. Report Bugs

If you encounter any issues while using theo, please help us by reporting them:

- **Check existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
- **Open a new issue** on GitHub Issues page
- **Include detailed information**:
    - Your operating system (macOS, Linux/Steam Deck)
    - theo tag or version (output of `theo version`)
    - Steps to reproduce the issue
    - Expected behavior vs actual behavior
    - Any error messages
    - Where you are installing from (vangogh, Steam), game id and language code (if applicable)

### 2. Contribute to Shared Data Sources

theo relies on data from [vangogh](https://github.com/arelate/vangogh) for game metadata. You can contribute to the ecosystem by:

- **Improving game metadata** in shared sources used by vangogh, e.g. PCGamingWiki, Wikipedia
- **Reporting data inconsistencies** or missing information

### 4. Request Features

Have an idea for a new feature? We'd love to hear it:

- **Open a feature request** on GitHub Issues
- **Describe the use case** and why it would be valuable
- **Provide examples** of how you envision it working

## Communication

- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports, feature requests, and discussions
- **Be respectful**: Follow our code of conduct and be kind to other community members
- **Be patient**: Maintainers are working on this project in their spare time

## Future Code Contributions

We may open up code contributions in the future once the project reaches a more stable state. If you're interested in contributing code:

- **Star and watch** the repository to stay updated
- **Engage with the community** through issues and discussions
- **Familiarize yourself** with the codebase and architecture
