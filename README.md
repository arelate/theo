# theo

`theo` is a command-line (CLI) client for [vangogh](https://github.com/arelate/vangogh) that allows downloading, installing and running games from your local DRM-free collection. At the moment `theo` implements support for macOS and Linux, tested on Steam Deck. Eventually `theo` hopes to provide a web GUI to manage your local games.

## Working with theo

 - [Installing theo](https://github.com/arelate/theo/wiki/Installing-theo)
 - [Connecting to vangogh](https://github.com/arelate/theo/wiki/Connecting-to-vangogh)
 - [Key theo commands](https://github.com/arelate/theo/wiki/Key-theo-commands)

## theo wouldn't be possible without...

- On macOS `theo` **requires** a version of [CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover) purchased and licensed for the current user. In the future I'm planning to switch to macOS WINE and DXMT.
- On Linux `theo` will use [umu-launcher](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher) and [proton-ge-custom](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) or, optionally, [umu-proton](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-proton). You don't need to do anything, theo will download the latest versions for you automatically from `vangogh`, as needed. Those will be installed under `theo` state folder, not globally and won't interfere with other apps.

## Why is it called theo?

Theodorus van Gogh (1 May 1857 – 25 January 1891) was a Dutch art dealer and the younger brother of Vincent van Gogh. Known as Theo, his support of his older brother's artistic ambitions and well-being allowed Vincent to devote himself entirely to painting. As an art dealer, Theo van Gogh played a crucial role in introducing contemporary French art to the public.
